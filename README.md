## 1. Linux Fundamentals 
Linux Administration is a fundamental skill for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). 
This section covers the basics of Linux, including command-line usage, file system navigation, and essential commands for managing files and processes.

-----------------
### A. Creating and managing Virtual Machines using VirtualBox and Vagrant in Local System.
  - Clone the GitHub repository: 
    git clone https://github.com/maifujalam/sre_learning.git
  - Follow VMs/README.md file for setting up Vagrant and VirtualBox.
  - Basic Vagrant commands for managing VMs (vagrant up, vagrant halt, vagrant destroy, vagrant ssh, etc.)

### B. Basic Linux commands and file system navigation.

  - File and directory management (ls, cd, mkdir, rm, mv, cp).
